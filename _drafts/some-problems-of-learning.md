When I set out to learn something new, I often need to review multiple references before 
I can understand a subject well, even when the subject is centuries old.

It's difficult to find a definitive reference that fits my needs, namely, 
the gaps in my knowledge, learning goals, and the limits of my skills.

Developing tools to improve the learning experience for 
students is within our reach using today's technology. 
However, a large amount of resources is required to develop them, 
which partly explains why such tools are not freely available to us today.

In this post, I want to tell you about people working on tools to improve the 
learning experience, tools that account for their individual needs, interests and goals.

## Say it

## How I re-discovered my interest in mathematics

I like mathematics, this wasn't always the case. I believe it was 2004, during the first
semester of university in Mexico City where I re-discovered how much I enjoyed the aha
moments that occur when I was able to finally grasp some difficult concept in mathematics.

I didn't really perform very well in the test for Calculus I -- differential calculus --
and I had to study for a remedial exam, so for a few weeks I spend most of my free
time in the library studying for this exam.

It was the first time in many years that really studied a subject with such discipline.
They were stressful times but after passed the exam I felt really good about the time I
invested and the things I learned.

## The problem with learning math late

Over the next year it was more and more clear that mathematics was really where my main
interests were. I wanted to switch schools around 2006 and do only math, but I was very
aware of the huge gaps in my knowledge and I also did not want to start over. I had
already invested 2 out of 4 years in university learning computer science and my
economic situation pushed me work as soon as I finished my university studies.

Out of need, I had to put on hold my desire to enroll in a masters program and so I started
to work. Not all was bad, my situation improved and for the first time in my life I was
able to afford to buy the books I wanted to read. My job was not too demanding and I would
spend many hours reading biographies of mathematicians in [MacTutor](#references) and also
learning some mathematical idea here and there.

Trying to learn mathematics while having a full time job required much more discipline
than I had imagined and I my motivation slowly waned away but my interest in mathematics
is as strong as ever. If only I was a math genius and I could get paid to learn more
mathematics it would be a nice life!

## What good writing can do, Halmos principles to write mathematics

Around 2010 I ran into Paul Halmos' article _[How to write mathematics](#references)_, it
contains many interesting ideas on how to structure written works about mathematics. The
principles laid out in the article got stuck in my head and I keep coming back to them.

Knowing who you are writing for will help you focus the material and only include the
parts that are really relevant. An author can simplify the task of the reader by providing
a simple linear structure and by avoiding referencing external material that would cause
a break in the flow of the text. 

The problems I face when trying to learn a particular mathematical idea can be
described in terms of violations of the principles mentioned before. 
Often I feel the need to break the flow of the text to find another reference, 
I find myself jumping back and forth in a book trying to make the connection between two
ideas, and a lot of the time I felt that I wasn't reading the right book.

Take the example of Calculus, it is difficult to find a reference that satisfies the 
constraints mentioned before, even when the core ideas are over three centuries old.
There are many excellent books about Calculus, however, once the book is writen and
published, it's content remains fixed, at least until the next edition. 

Adapting the treatment of the subject in real time would improve the learning 
experience greatly. [Adaptive learning](#references) methods achieve this through the use of 
computerized learning systems that create a model the individual student and use it
to generate customized curricula matching their profile. 

## Knowledge as a graph as a simple model

- concepts and relationships
    - a model that allows for
        - high level of automation in organizing, querying
        - finding the best learning path given a goal and a student profile
- levels of abstraction
  - difficulty
  - student profile
  - student goals
- UX challenges

## Obstacles: cost, technical barriers, organizational barriers

- producing the content is a massive undertaking
- content producers gotta eat
- access to the tools is not free
- obstacles to changing education systems
- providing as a supplementary
