## Dependency diagram

This belongs to another post, the one about the concept of infrastructure:

4. diagram of the boot sequence, maybe a simplified version of it?
5. the boot sequence can be inverted, deriving the need for each component from the
client needs/requirements, as opposed of building from the bottom up. This is a
recurring theme, whether to model the infra from the bottom up or from the top down,
has implication in its management and the assumption around autonomy and control.
1. with top bottom, we focus on control, at the expense of autonomy ................
2. with bottom up, we focus on flexibility and autonomy, at the expense of
duplication and drift
