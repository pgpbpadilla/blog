Paul Halmos was a mathematician who among other things was recognized by his excellent
written mathematical exposition.

His article on [how to write mathematics](#related) left a lasting impression on me. This
year I
decided to read his article one more time, and to capture some notes for my
future reference.

Fortunately many of the ideas in the article are applicable too to non-mathematical
writing and therefore useful for anyone who wants to improve their expository skills.

## Have something to say

There are only a few things worse than someone saying a lot about nothing. So, keep it
concise.

When writing, it's useful to review your text and ensure you're not mixing too many
ideas since this will make it harder for the reader to remember what you wrote.


## Write for your audience

Writing for a specific audience makes things simpler because you can make big
assumptions about their shared knowledge.

Writing for a general audience is difficult because any assumption you make will likely
be wrong.

## Organizing the text

A good start is to organize the text in three sections, sometimes referred as the
Aristotelian triptych: _Say what you're going to say, say it, say what you said_.

### Say what you're going to say

Prepare your audience for what's coming. In this section you can motivate the topic by
providing some historical background in a way that shows the connections between the
ideas of previous thinkers and the ones that will be discussed later in your text.


### Say it

Provide examples and carefully draw connections between them and the main concepts.
Counter-examples are also useful here to delimit the scope of your text.


### Say what you said

Remind your audience about the most important takeaways. Make them short and memorable.
