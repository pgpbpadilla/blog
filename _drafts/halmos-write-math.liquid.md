Paul Halmos was a mathematician who among other things was recognized by his excellent
written exposition. His article on [how to write mathematics](#related) left a lasting 
impression on me, and this year I decided to read it one more time and capture some 
notes for my future reference.

Although the title of his article has the word _mathematics_ in it, the ideas 
presented are generally applicable and therefore useful to anyone who wants to improve 
their skills.

## Have something to say

Saying a lot about nothing is worse than having nothing to say.

If you have something to say, keep it concise.

Do not introduce too many ideas, it will be harder to remember tha main one.


## Write for your audience

Writing for a specific audience makes things simpler because you can make big
assumptions about their shared knowledge.

Writing for a general audience is difficult because any assumption you make will likely
be wrong.

## Organizing the text

A good start is to organize the text in three sections, sometimes referred as the
Aristotelian triptych: _Say what you're going to say, say it, say what you said_.

### Say what you're going to say

Prepare your audience for what's coming. In this section you can motivate the topic by
providing some historical background in a way that shows the connections between the
ideas of previous thinkers and the ones that will be discussed later in your text.


### Say it

Make your text as self-contained as possible, do not interrupt the reader's flow by 
making references to ideas outside the current text.

Provide examples and carefully draw connections between them and the main concepts.
Counter-examples are also useful here to delimit the scope of your text.


### Say what you said

Remind your audience about the most important takeaways. Make them short and memorable.


## Arrange

/Organizing/ the material is about drawing the interconnections between 
ideas, /arranging/ is about choosing the order in which they will be presented.


### The spiral plan

Once you have an outline for the text, start writing the first section, then write the 
second one, go back and read the first section, you will often find things that 
could be improved, now you can go back and rewrite the first section.

Continue writing the next section, now go back and review the previous ones, rewrite 
what needs to be rewritten and repeat until it's good enough.


### Linearizing dependencies

Choose the order in which you want to present the text. One way to make things easier
for the reader is to arrange the sections in a linear order, so that they don't have
to jump back and forth.

## Write

Start writing. Write bit by bit. Focus on the process, write a little each time. 
Focusing on the end goal can increase anxiety and lead to procrastination.

As you write, continuously review what you've written using the spiral plan to find 
more connections and possible improvements.

Stop. Do not write more than what's necessary to communicate your message. If you 
follow the spiral plan you will have plenty of opportunities to find gaps, mistakes or 
other things to fix.

## Re-write and re-write

When you find something that can be improved, or that should be fixed, try rewriting 
it instead of just editing it. Rewriting gives you the opportunity to express it in a 
totally different -- and hopefully better -- way. You don't get that by editing just 
sections of the text.
 
## Mechanical detail matter

Check your work for mistakes, orthographic problems, style issues, inconsistent use of 
notation or terminology. Also, try to use punctuation correctly.

Too many mistakes can distract your audience from what you are trying to say.
