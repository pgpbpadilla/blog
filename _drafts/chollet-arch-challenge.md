In 2019 Fran√ßois Chollet published ARC in the [Kaggle platform](#references) as a 
challenge to build a system that can solve previously unknown tasks with limited examples.

## what are you going to say

Chollet thinks modern approaches to create intelligent systems will not lead to human-like
intelligence. 

Systems require many examples and cannot extrapolate. They can only interpolate between 
known examples.

Limiting the number of examples prevents the use of data-hungry techniques for machine
learning.

The challenge is proposed as a step in the direction of building intelligent systems 
that show greater generalization capacity.

## say it

### Description of the challenge

### Example tasks

### Expectations from solving the challenge

## what you said 

The focus for this direction of research is in building systems that can solve multiple
types of human-relevant tasks with a limited number of examples, therefore getting closer
to the prime example of general intelligence, human intelligence.
