In 2019 Fran√ßois Chollet published ARC in the [Kaggle platform](#references) as a 
challenge to build a system that can solve previously unknown tasks with limited examples.

## The ARC benchmach

- it has been designed to


## Baked in human priors

A key ingredient for Chollet's during the evaluation of artificial agents is that the
agent specification must include human priors.

### Object-ness

An example of a human prior is, the intuition about what makes up and object,
and how objects interact in the physical world. This is sometimes referred to as
intuitive physics.

### Agency


### Theory of mind
