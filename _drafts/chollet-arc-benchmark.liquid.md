## TODO

 - maybe split up in to multiple posts?
 - at least 3, chollets definition, the arc benchmarch on kaggle, the winning solution

Francis Chollet is a researcher in the field of AI, he has proposed the ARC benchmark
as a sort of IQ test for artificially intelligent agents. This post is about what the
ARC benchmark is and how it was solved in the Kaggle platform.

Francois is the creator of the Keras neural networks library.

# Chollet's disagreement with the Hutter camp

- Having the goal of a Universal Intelligence is not sound, we cannot assess other
  types of intelligence
- A proper goal is human-like intelligence
- We can only evaluate agents when their intelligence is like ours
- We need to include/define the priors, and they must be human priors
  in order to get human-like intelligence at the end

## A definition for intelligence


## The ARC benchmach

- it has been designed to

## The winner from the challente

How did he win? shortcut, genuine intelligence?

## Discussion/Outro

- it has not been fully solved
- participant agents rely on exploiting weaknesses of ARC instead of showing the
expected type of intelligence
