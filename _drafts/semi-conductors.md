## TODO

- diagram with companies involved in each step of the process
- it shows end to end the steps in the process of manufacturing semi-conductors
- at each step it also shows what companies are involved today
- this could be a good idea for a series on semi-conductors

## Process

- from sand to silicon
- wafer manufactoring
- fab vs fabless
- what is a foundry
- AMSL, TSMC and EUV LLC
