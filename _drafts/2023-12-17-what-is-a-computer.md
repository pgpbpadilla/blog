Recently I have been asking colleagues and friends questions about how
what they think a computer is. It's a bit strange that I can usually
turn the answers into more questions to the point where a computer is
not what they thought it was.


# Programmability is optional

Talking with an Robotics teacher &#x2013; teaches the basics about Robots to
kids &#x2013; I asked: are Robots computers? The answer was a clear and
confident, yes! The dialog then went on roughly as follows:

-   P: if you have a Robot with a fixed program, is that still a
    computer?
-   T: yes
-   P: a computer is typically an electronic circuit that can run some
    sort of program. A calculator is an electronic gadget with a fixed
    program, one that can evaluate arithmetic expressions. Is a
    calculator a computer?
-   T: hmmm&#x2026; I guess it is

So it seems that programmability is an optional component of computers.


# Electronics are optional

During college, I was taught that anything that an algorithm is
anythin that takes inputs, processes them in some way and then
produces an output. The computer is the thing that executes/runs a
program, however a computer can be realized with non-electronic
components. For many years before electronics became the main way
to realize computers there were other methods of manufacturing
them. In fact, for a while humans were called computers and were in
charge of solving tons of math problems which in some cases needed
not a lot of deep thought or problem solving skills, but simply
having the ability to follow a set of pre-defined instructions
mindlessly.

Another historical note, the abstract description of the
[Turing Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine)
already captures the essence of a computer, a computer program and
computation, all that just just pen and paper, no need for fancy
electronics.


# What is a computer program?

In modern computers a program typically is a text file written with
some special syntax stored somewhere in a disk. The program can be
read any time by the computer and its instructions followed blindly
by following a strict set of rules.

A program is composed of a sequence of basic instructions plus
a few special instructions to control the flow of the program. You
could say that programming is nothing more than performing a series
of dumb tasks, deciding which instruction to execute next and a way
to tell the computer how to execute a series of steps
repeatedly. <sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>

That being said, a computer program does not necessary have to make
use of all those possibilities, a simple program that outputs a
fixed string of text once and then terminates is a perfecly
respectable program.


# Where is the program?

So can programs be encoded in other ways? Think about a pair of
sunglasses, the glass is manufactured in such a way that certain
types of light are filtered out; in a sense this action of
filtering out is a decision of what to let through the glass. As
lightrays come through the glass the rules (program) encoded in the
structure of the glass is continuously computing which rays should
be filtered out. So are sunglasses computers?

What about other physical objects? a glass of water is built
(programmed) in such a way as to contain liquids. The program is
again encoded in the structure of the glass.

We can go on and try to extend this thinking to pretty much any
other object that is made by man to fullfill a specific purpose. An
even to those that were accidentally discovered.

If you agree that such objects are all computers, then I think you
might also agree that a computer program can be encoded in the
structure of physical objects, the same way that we build
electronic circuits in specific ways so that they behave the way we
want.


# Is everything a computer?

You decide.

I think that Thomas Kuhn might say more that a Computer is [a
paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm).
