Learning is hard. This is a memoir about how I used to think about the idea of 
knowledge, it's organization and how to help myself learn efficiently.

## On learning mathematics

As an undergraduate student of Computer Science Engineering, I discovered my liking of 
mathematics during the first two years of my bachelors degree (2004-2005).

For a short while I 
considered changing schools to study mathematics but after learning that it would mean 
to start my bachelors from scratch I decided to continue studying Computer Science 
Engineering.

### Giving up mathematics ... as a profession

After completing my bachelors, I wanted to know what would it take to continue with a 
masters in mathematics, I realized almost immediately that I didn't have the 
background or the necessary level to even pass the admission examination.

I was quite upset about that, however, even I had the talent to pull it off, I could 
not afford to continue studying, I needed to find a job asap.


### Reading about mathematics

I got my first job as a Quality Assurance Analyst at a bank in Mexico City almost 
right after I finished my bachelors. During my spare time, I enjoyed reading about 
mathematics, it's history, biographies of famous mathematicians, and I tried to get an 
idea about the scope of mathematics and it's limitations.


### It's all about the theorems!

Understanding mathematics was quite a bit of work for me, I usually needed to review 
the same concepts from different references until I found one that I could understand.

During my bachelors I had some short encounters with several topics in mathematics 
applied to engineering, e.g., Calculus, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, 
Probability Theory, etc.

I was always annoyed by repetitive mechanical computation and mostly drawn to the more 
abstract aspects of these mathematical tools, rather than their applications.

However, part of learning many mathematical concepts works really well by first 
mastering the mechanical skills, which in turn helped build an intuition about the 
underlying more abstract concepts.

I was particularly interested but also terrified of theorem proving, but I did 
understand that in mathematics it's all about the theorems. One can solve a thousand 
special cases of a problem but the really cool stuff was to be able to prove that a 
certain property is true for a whole set of problems so that by solving the general 
case all instances of that class of problems are also solved.

Connecting seemingly unrelated areas of mathematics via theorems was also a recurring 
theme during my readings, and it has remained one of my favorite aspects of mathematics.

And the best of all, once a theorem is proved, it remains true forever! Is there 
anything better than that?


### Reading Paul Halmos 

I had this idea that in order to get better at learning mathematics, it would help to 
read Halmos' advice on how to write mathematics for an audience who wants to learn them.

The article left a lasting impression on me and to this day I keep going back to ideas 
in it.

You can find my notes on it in: [Halmos' tips for writing](#related).


## Automating Halmos' principles

I started to develop the conviction that we could automate the process of mathematical 
research and eventually all scientific research.


## Knetledge: the network of knowledge

Knowledge can be thought of as a network or graph, where the nodes represent concepts 
and the links the relationships between concepts.

When modelling knowledge as a network, then it could be possible to write computer 
programs to automatically analyze the structure of the network.

From this one could identify nodes that were not connected but that would be likely to 
be related, all automaticallyl inferred from the structure of the network.

It could also be possible to group a subset of concepts and relationships and label it 
as a new concept. In this way, concepts can be nested, and it's concepts all the way down.


## Areas of application

A system like that could be used in many ways, it could be consulted and answer 
complicated questions about any domain of knowledge, it could be used to shorten the 
time it takes to learn anything by generating the most efficient personalized study 
curricula for any student. 

And of course, why not let it just take over the whole business of scientific research.

### Personalized learning curricula

This was and still is very close to my heart. I am a junky for learning new things, 
however I lack the discipline, time, motivation and many other things to be successful 
at learning all the things I want.

Having a system that knows exactly where I stand, what I know, and is able to 
adapt to generate the most suitable curricula so that I can master any concept is a 
dream that has not died.

### Oracles

What does it take to build a ship for interstellar travel? What do we need to do to 
live in a peaceful and prosperous civilization? These are difficult questions that we 
have not been able to answer to my satisfaction.

It would be amazing to have a system that can handle them. One clear gap from where we 
are now and where we would need to be is that we don't have the ability to benefit 
from the learnings of other societies easily.

We also don't have a global inventory of our natural resources in a way that's usable 
to such a system so that it can make good predictions or suggestions for us.


## Is this wikipedia or the world wide web?

When I talked about this with my professor Nu√±o, he asked me if this was not what 
wikipedia already is.


Wikipedia is a great start,

Multimedia support is amazing and, having the ability to embed different kinds of
media (text, audio, video, etc) is definitely a good start.
but it lacks some desireable features, for example:

- the answers that you get are as good as your ability to search and connect the dots.
- The content does not adapt to the audience, if an article is very technical, many 
  non-technical readers might not be able to benefit from it.
- We cannot query it like an Oracle
- It cannot automatically connect unrelated concepts 
- It cannot identify new concepts by labeling subsets of the network

The web and wikipedia have many cool features, and it's definitly great to have them, 
however they still cannot replace humans for scientific research or for the design of 
suitable learning curricula.

## So what's missing

- automated personalized learning curricula
- oracles
