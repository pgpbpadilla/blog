At the time I could think of the following related goals, which I intend to explore in
future posts:

### Related goals for students

- provide tools to make it easy for students to explore a topic of interest free-style
- create private collections of selected topics and allow to re-organize them as they see fit
- share private collections
- allow others to see what topics you've worked on, and those you're interested in
- collaborate with other students building shared collections

### Other related goals

- create computer programs to automatically find patterns in the graph and:
    - suggest new relationships between existing concepts
    - synthesize new concepts
    - answer queries about the knowledge in the graph, e.g.
        - how to solve inter-stellar travel?
        - how to cure aging?
        - how to become a sustainable civilization?
