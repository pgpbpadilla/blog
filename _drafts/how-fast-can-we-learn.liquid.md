How long does it take to make an original contribution to a specific field of knowledge?
Is it possible to save time? If so, how much?

In 2010, I was working in Mexico City as a Quality Assurance Analyst
for Ixe Banco. It was my first job and for some reason I couldn't understand
my lunch break had to be 2hrs, I could not shorten it in order to leave
earlier in the afternoon. It was a weird schedule.

During these long lunch breaks I had time to read a bit and at the time I was reading
Paul Halmos' article: _[How to write mathematics](#references)_, in it, Halmos explained his
process of writing mathematics. For a long time I have wished I could make some
type of contribution to the field. However, I had no formal training in mathematics
and only got excited about it when I was about 20 years old, a bit too late to start
a career as a mathematician.

Some days I would sit and try to solve problems from [Spivak's Calculus](#references),
my progress was slow, and not all of it was fun. Sometimes the material was too difficult,
it takes a while to get used to the definition, theorem, proof structure of many
texts on mathematics, specially following long proofs with steps that seem unjustified.

When things started to get too hard I would try to find a different reference for the same
theorem and hope that it would somehow be easier to understand. Other times I would try to
focus on the practical applications, perhaps after a couple of examples, it would illuminate
the proof, I thought.

I had a really hard time finding resources that included both a rigorous treatment, together
with practical examples and visualisations for the key ideas. The rigorous texts often
ignore the practical and visual aspects, and the practical books, with nice graphs and
practical examples usually did not explain how to derive the key formulas.

## There is no _standard_ treatment for Calculus

The core ideas of Calculus are about 300 years old and to the best of my knowledge, there
is no universally accepted canonical treatment of the subject for undergraduate courses.
There are a few classical books from well know authors (Spivak, Hardy, Courant, and Apostol)
and it's best to study them all because each has a different profile as I explained before.

As a recent college graduate -- in 2010 --, I could not decide, which reference to use.
Some were too hard/abstract, some did not include the derivations of formulas, some did
not include a step by step proof I could follow and worse than that, the time and effort
to review all of them was massive.

## Is there an optimal learning path?

Depending on the needs, and goals of the students, finding adequate references for a
subject can be even more complicated. The material needs to cover the gaps in their
knowledge, at the same time it should include sufficient practical examples or go
really deep into how to derive certain results while keeping the exposition to a level
where the student can understand.

Given a particular student, their base knowledge, and their goals or needs, how could we
find the optimal learning path? One that fulfills their goals with minimal investment of
resources.

Judging by the duration and syllabus of top universities in the english-speaking world,
this remains an open question. Choosing what to remove from the student curricula seems
to be a problem more difficult than I initially imagined.

## Is it a problem of how to organize material?

Why is it so hard to come up with an optimal learning path? One idea is that it has to do
with how the material is organized and presented. Halmos writes about these two aspects
when he described his method for writing mathematics. Writing with a specific audience
in mind, making the material self-contained, providing a logical sequence and
reiterating the important ideas are insights that made Halmos stand out as writer of
mathematics.

Let's imagine we had a learning system built on Halmos principles. Could we
then create better learning paths for students? Such a system would need to:

- understand the student's profile so that it only includes relevant material,
- avoid breaking the student's flow by not requiring the student to lookup other materials,
- provide feedback about the progress made in order to motivate the student to continue, and
- give the student enough space to gain mastery of the subject under study

## Knowledge as a network of concepts

We could represent knowledge as a graph, where the nodes stand for specific concepts,
and the links describe the relationships between them. A Network of Knowledge or
_Knetledge_ for short.

The problem seemed to have been reduced to finding a path in this "knowledge graph". A
path with its origin representing the knowledge the student already has, and with its
destination being the student learning goals. For example, a goal for a student might be
to understand how to formally derive the main formulas for the derivative of a function
of a single real variable given that they already know how to use limits.

## The student's journey

Let's imagine a hypothetical math student, it may take many years before they can
make their first original contribution to the field, a possible journey might be
something like:

```
Primary Ed. --> Secondary Ed. --> Higher Ed. --> Postgraduate studies
```

Many students that begin this journey may start their postgraduate studies around
their 24th year of age. Would it be possible to complete this journey sooner and
with less effort if students had access to our hypothetical optimal learning path?
