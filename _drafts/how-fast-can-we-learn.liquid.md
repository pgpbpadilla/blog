## Say what you're going to say

There's a problem I face anytime I have tried to learn a new concept.
I usually need to review multiple references on the subject before I can make progress,
even when the core ideas in the subject are centuries old.

It's really difficult to find a single reference for a specific topic which directly
address me as a student, considering the gaps in my knowledge, my goals in learning the
subject and the limits of my skill in mastering the subject.

If we think of knowledge as a graph of concepts interconnected by their relationships, then
I can imagine the kind of tools a student might want to improve their learning experience.
However, the effort required to develop such tools is massive and partly explains why
such tools are not freely available to all students.

I would like to bring attention to this problem and to some people already working on
different approaches to get us closer to a place where any student can experience
learning in a way that accounts for their individual needs, interests and goals.
