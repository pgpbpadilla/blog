#+BIND: org-md-toplevel-hlevel 2

Test file to demonstrate that =ox-md= does not honor the heading
leavel for Footnotes. 

* level 1

  Given that this file sets:

  #+begin_src org
  #+BIND: org-md-toplevel-hlevel 2
  #+end_src
  
  A Level 1 heading should be exported to Level 2. [fn:1]

   
** level2

   And a Level 2 heading should be exported to Level 3


* Footnotes

  Footnotes should be exported to Level 2. However, they are always
  exported as Level 1.

  In, the whole body is igored!

  
[fn:1] a footnote
