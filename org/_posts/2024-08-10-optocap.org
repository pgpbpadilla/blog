In the near future, NeuroLight Corporation revolutionized neuroscience
with a procedure that replaced the top of the human skull with an
artificial cap. This "OptoCap" embedded with micro-scale light
emitters, allowed precise control over brain activity through
optogenetics—a technique that used light to manipulate neurons
engineered to be light-sensitive.

* The Decision

  Lena sat in the waiting room of NeuroLight Corporation, surrounded
  by holographic displays promoting the incredible achievements of
  those enhanced by the OptoCap.

  "Ms. Torres?" called Ethan, a consultant with a polished
  demeanor. He ushered her into a futuristic office and gestured for
  her to sit.

  “You’re about to unlock your full potential,” Ethan began,
  projecting an image of a brain onto the glass table between
  them. “The OptoCap can amplify your confidence, intelligence,
  creativity—whatever you need.”

  Lena had always been cautious, but the promise of self-improvement
  was enticing. “Can it really make me more decisive?”

  “With optogenetic programming, you can reshape your neural pathways
  to strengthen any trait you desire,” Ethan explained. “Imagine
  eliminating self-doubt or boosting your cognitive speed.”

  Lena’s resolve hardened. “Let’s do it.”


* The Installation

  The procedure was quick. Lena awoke feeling a slight weight on her
  head, her cap glowing faintly.

  “Welcome to your new life, Lena,” Dr. Harmon, the chief scientist,
  said as he handed her a sleek control tablet. “With this, you can
  select programs to modulate brain states.”

  Lena marveled at the array of options. She felt powerful, like an
  artist with an unlimited palette.


* The Exploration

  Within days, Lena transformed. Her confidence surged, making her an
  instant leader at work. The OptoCap’s programs allowed her to adjust
  her mood and cognition with a few taps.

  At home, she selected the "Creative Boost" setting for an upcoming
  project. Waves of inspiration washed over her, unlocking ideas she
  never imagined.

  One evening, as she explored deeper into her cap’s settings, Lena
  found an unfamiliar program. When she opened it, memories of board
  meetings and conversations she didn’t remember participating in
  flooded her mind.


* The Revelation

  Alarmed, Lena contacted Ethan. He arrived quickly, his usual composure
  replaced by nervousness.

  “Lena, I assure you, everything is fine,” he began, but Lena cut him
  off.

  “I found a program logging my thoughts. What is NeuroLight doing?”

  Ethan hesitated. “There are built-in data collection systems. The
  company uses them to monitor user feedback...and sometimes influence.”

  “Influence?” Lena repeated, incredulous. “You mean control.”

  Ethan nodded, cornered. “It’s part of ensuring compliance and
  optimizing the system.”

  Realization struck Lena—she was being manipulated. Her mind was not
  her own.
