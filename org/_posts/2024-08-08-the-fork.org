* Take 1: Endless forms

  In the year 2160, the city of Aria stood as a beacon of progress and
  unity. Here, the Selected, a privileged class born sterile due to
  atypical sex differentiation, had risen to power. For centuries,
  they had been marginalized due to their inability to reproduce
  traditionally, but with advancements in genetic engineering, they
  found a new purpose.

  The Selected devised a system where offspring were created through a
  combination of their original DNA and advanced genetic
  engineering. This method allowed the creation of highly adaptive,
  intelligent, and emotionally balanced humans who were celebrated as
  the "Neo-Gens." The old societal emphasis on sexual reproduction
  dwindled, as the Neo-Gens quickly demonstrated extraordinary talents
  and harmonious temperaments.

  With the Selected in leadership positions, they shifted governmental
  incentives to focus on intellectual and creative contributions rather
  than traditional family structures. Those who excelled in arts,
  sciences, and community leadership were rewarded with resources and
  opportunities, fostering a society driven by merit and innovation.

  As decades passed, the city of Aria flourished. Conflicts over
  resources diminished, as collaboration became the cornerstone of
  society. With genetic diversity and innovation at the forefront,
  diseases that plagued the human race for centuries were eradicated,
  and the environment thrived under careful stewardship.

  Elders sat in the serene Gardens of Aria, observing children playingâ€”a
  new generation that knew no prejudice or inequality. The Selected
  watched with pride, knowing they had not only survived but had
  reshaped humanity's fate.



* Take 2: The future is sterile

  By 2160, the Omega Line, once a marginalized class, defined by their
  sterility, had seized control of the city of Aria. With
  advancements in genetic engineering, they began creating offspring
  not through traditional means but by combining their DNA with
  engineered enhancements, producing the Neo-Gens.

  The shift from sexual reproduction to engineered births led
  to societal unrest. Traditional families, feeling threatened by the
  new system, protested against what they saw as an erosion of human
  nature. The government, now dominated by the Omega Line, responded
  with strict laws that favored the Neo-Gens, marginalizing those who
  clung to old ways.

  The promise of progress gave way to control. Society split into two
  classes: the genetically engineered Neo-Gens and the "Naturals," those
  born through traditional reproduction. Naturals faced increasing
  discrimination, relegated to menial jobs, and barred from leadership
  roles.

  As the divide deepened, Aria became a city under surveillance, where
  dissenters were swiftly silenced. The Omega Line, in their bid to
  maintain control, implemented a draconian regime, manipulating
  genetics to create a generation of Neo-Gens devoid of free will.

  Hope flickered among the Naturals, who formed underground resistance
  groups, determined to restore the balance and ensure diversity in
  human evolution. But the Omega Line's grip was strong, and for every
  small victory, the resistance suffered great losses.

  Life continues in the city as the Omega Line maintains a firm grip
  on the government. Stories circulate about Normals walking
  among the general population, though no one has had direct contact
  with them since the fork.
