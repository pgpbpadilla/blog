Welcome to my blog! I started it to practice my writing skills and to
promote ideas that I find interesting.

I am a computer programmer by training, many of the
topics revolve around that field.

The idea of automating the organization and discovery of knowledge has
been in my mind since 2008 and this blog is an attempt to wrap my head
around it.
