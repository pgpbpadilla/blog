<p>
<a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> package upgrades have regularly broken my personal setup,
blocking me from completing my current task. My <a href="https://github.com/pgpbpadilla/homebrew-pgpb">personal Homebrew tap</a>
saved the day recently, so it deserves a mention here.
</p>


<p>
I accidentally upgraded all my Homebrew packages with:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orge164a1c">
brew upgrade
</pre>

<p>
Later I noticed that saving <a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/encrypting-files.html">encrypted files in Emacs</a> was <a href="https://dev.gnupg.org/T6481">not
working</a>. Anytime I tried saving changes Emacs would hang.
</p>

<p>
After googling I found that others were having the same issue after
upgrading their <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a> package.
</p>

<p>
I was able to fix the problem after following <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/76404609/400544">instructions from
StackOverflow</a>. However, that didn't last, I ran into the same
trouble with my work computer. This time it was different, I had
updated my setup to pin the <a href="https://semver.org/">minor version</a> of GnuPG to 2.2, so I was
surprised that even though the <i>correct</i> version was installed, Emacs
would still hang during encryption.
</p>

<p>
The difference was that my personal and work computers were using
different PATCH versions:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Work: <b>2.2.42</b></li>
<li>Personal: <b>2.2.41</b></li>
</ul>


<p>
Homebrew does not provide <a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Versions">versioned formulas</a> for different PATCH
versions of a package, so I couldn't use:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org5c629f9">
brew install gnupg@2.2.41
</pre>

<p>
I once had a similar situation, I needed to pin the version of package
with no versioned formula. To do that, I created a personal <a href="https://docs.brew.sh/How-to-Create-and-Maintain-a-Tap">Homebrew
tap</a> and defined a formula for the desired package.
</p>

<p>
To fix my configuration, I found the <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gnupg@2.2">formula for gnupg@2.2</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pgpbpadilla/homebrew-pgpb/blob/master/Formula/gnupg%402.2.41.rb">tweaked
it</a>, so that it installed version 2.2.41. This worked fine, the main
downside was that the install time got longer since the package is
built from sources, no biggie.
</p>

<p>
I decided to spend the time to write this since it's the second time
my personal tap has saved the day. So if you're GnuPG is broken in the
same way you can use it too!

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">brew tap pgpbpadilla/pgpb
brew install gnupg@2.2.41
</pre>
