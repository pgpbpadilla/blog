<p>
During my career in Software, the problem of estimating the time,
effort and cost of a software project has been one of the hardest.

<p>
When I learned about Scrum, I was totally convinced that estimation
was legit. It bothered me that when estimating using Fibonacci
numbers, people would try to do arithmetic with them like it meant
something. It doesn't. Calculating <i>velocity</i> was more or less
pointless.
</p>

<p>
I still buy that relative estimation was better than absolute
estimation, however, in order to get good at estimating, you have to
have seen many similar items. In my career, I have been switching
technologies and industries every couple of years so pretty much
every task is, in some sense, different and it's hard to compare
with the past.
</p>

<p>
The time discussing whether something is an X, XL or XXL was almost
too much for me. I wanted to get started building something small,
then extend it a bit, then a bit more, you know, iterative and
incremental progress instead of trying to nail down an accurate
estimate the first time.
</p>

<p>
Today I am convinced that estimation in this way is a complete waste
of time.

<p>
While looking for alternatives I found the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVBlnCTu9Ms">#NoEstimates video</a> from
<a href="https://holub.com/">Allen Holub</a> and I was hooked. The idea of using past performance to
make projections about the future was already present in Scrum and I
was more or less comfortable taking it for granted. Calculating
velocity never really made much sense to me, given what I said about
doing arithmetic with Fibonacci numbers, can you imagine doing it
with T-Shirt sizes?
</p>

<p>
Holub proposes instead to do away with all the time used for trying
to estimate a task and instead ensure that tasks are as small and
that they are prioritised. Nobody wants to spend time doing stuff
that does not matter.
</p>

<p>
Measuring actual time it takes to complete enables you to stop using
guesstimates, it's faster and easier to do. Making tasks small means
there are more data points (measurements) available to create a
forecast/projection of how long it may take to complete a list of
tasks.

<h2 id="org4afece7">Priorities</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4afece7">
<p>
With agile estimation, you don't know when a particular item in the
backlog will be completed. This gets more difficult as more stories
are dropped in order to make the deadline.
</p>

<p>
A forecast will tell you the likelihood of completing a specific
task at a given time and it can be recalculated as you rearrange
items in the backlog.
</p>

<p>
The ease and speed of calculating a forecast can be a stronger
motivator for decision makers to try and rearrange the backlog with
confidence in order to visualise different scenarios. This is harder
to do with agile estimation methods since it's difficult to
anticipate the impact that rearranging the backlog will have on the
completion date of a task.

<h2 id="orgcf76ab7">Challenges</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcf76ab7">
<p>
Measurements + forecasting seem to me like they should yield better
results when used for project estimation. However, it's difficult to
apply. Even if you manage to master all the concepts of how to
properly use a forecasting technique, you still need to provide your
estimate of the project's cost and effort and duration before you
can get the money to start the project.
</p>

<p>
Another difficulty is that once a project is started, it's difficult
to gain mind share about using a forecast instead of
estimates. People are already struggling to make sense of Agile
estimation methods given all of their obvious pitfalls. Convincing
them to use something like a Monte-Carlo simulation to forecast the
likelihood of a task being done at a particular point in time can be
challenging at best.
