<p>
Welcome to my blog! I started it to practice my writing skills and to
promote ideas that I find interesting.
</p>

<p>
I am a computer programmer by training, many of the
topics revolve around that field.
</p>

<p>
The idea of automating the organization and discovery of knowledge has
been in my mind since 2008 and this blog is an attempt to wrap my head
around it.
