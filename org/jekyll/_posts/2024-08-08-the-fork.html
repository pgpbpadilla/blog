In the year 2160, the city of Aria stood as a beacon of progress and
unity. Here, the Selected, a privileged class born sterile due to
atypical sex differentiation, had risen to power. For centuries,
they had been marginalized due to their inability to reproduce
traditionally, but with advancements in genetic engineering, they
found a new purpose.
</p>

<p>
The Selected devised a system where offspring were created through a
combination of their original DNA and advanced genetic
engineering. This method allowed the creation of highly adaptive,
intelligent, and emotionally balanced humans who were celebrated as
the "Neo-Gens." The old societal emphasis on sexual reproduction
dwindled, as the Neo-Gens quickly demonstrated extraordinary talents
and harmonious temperaments.
</p>

<p>
With the Selected in leadership positions, they shifted governmental
incentives to focus on intellectual and creative contributions rather
than traditional family structures. Those who excelled in arts,
sciences, and community leadership were rewarded with resources and
opportunities, fostering a society driven by merit and innovation.
</p>

<p>
As decades passed, the city of Aria flourished. Conflicts over
resources diminished, as collaboration became the cornerstone of
society. With genetic diversity and innovation at the forefront,
diseases that plagued the human race for centuries were eradicated,
and the environment thrived under careful stewardship.
</p>

<p>
Elders sat in the serene Gardens of Aria, observing children playingâ€”a
new generation that knew no prejudice or inequality. The Selected
watched with pride, knowing they had not only survived but had
reshaped humanity's fate.

<p>
By 2160, the Omega Line, once a marginalized class, defined by their
sterility, had seized control of the city of Aria. With
advancements in genetic engineering, they began creating offspring
not through traditional means but by combining their DNA with
engineered enhancements, producing the Neo-Gens.
</p>

<p>
The shift from sexual reproduction to engineered births led
to societal unrest. Traditional families, feeling threatened by the
new system, protested against what they saw as an erosion of human
nature. The government, now dominated by the Omega Line, responded
with strict laws that favored the Neo-Gens, marginalizing those who
clung to old ways.
</p>

<p>
The promise of progress gave way to control. Society split into two
classes: the genetically engineered Neo-Gens and the "Naturals," those
born through traditional reproduction. Naturals faced increasing
discrimination, relegated to menial jobs, and barred from leadership
roles.
</p>

<p>
As the divide deepened, Aria became a city under surveillance, where
dissenters were swiftly silenced. The Omega Line, in their bid to
maintain control, implemented a draconian regime, manipulating
genetics to create a generation of Neo-Gens devoid of free will.
</p>

<p>
Hope flickered among the Naturals, who formed underground resistance
groups, determined to restore the balance and ensure diversity in
human evolution. But the Omega Line's grip was strong, and for every
small victory, the resistance suffered great losses.
</p>

<p>
Life continues in the city as the Omega Line maintains a firm grip
on the government. Stories circulate about Normals walking
among the general population, though no one has had direct contact
with them since the fork.
