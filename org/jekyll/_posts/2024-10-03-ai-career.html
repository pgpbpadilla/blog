<p>
At the end of 2022, after 14 years as a software engineer working in
mercenary mode I was ready for a change &#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Working as a software engineer can be stressful. The pace of
modern/agile software teams is fast, bi-weekly sprints,
continuous delivery, you build it &#x2026; you run it, etc.. On top of
that, having to learning next programming tool/technique is very
demanding.
</p>

<p>
I have always been more of a thinker than a tinkerer; I like to look
at at topic from different angles, do some research, try a few
things, step back and switch to something else while I let my
uncounsious process what I've learned, this personality was not
compatible with my job.
</p>

<p>
During my vaction around the end of 2021 I was going over my life
choices and career prospects, most of my career I had jumped to the
next role as soon as I found something that was attractive enough. I
was now ready to commit to a long-term project/role but first I
needed to do some research to understand my options and compare them
somehow.
</p>

<h2 id="org058b9f3"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Act II</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
I would summarize my career as writing network clients for the first
half and then writing application servers and release automation for
the other half. In a sense I felt that I had been doing the same
over and over for the past 10 years, only with different
technologies. I needed a change, something tha was more compatible
with my personality and preferences.
</p>

<p>
I didn't feel that I could make a drastic change like going out of
the software world. Writing software is the only thing I had more
than 10 years of practical experience with and where some might even
consider me an expert. I am not a big risk taker so I only
considered alternative paths that could benefit from my professional
background.
</p>

<p>
I had been thinking about switching roles for a while and there were
two main topics that invaded my thoughts on a regular basis:
infrastructure automation and artificial intelligence.
</p>

<p>
In my las few software projects, I would spend a lot of my time
thinking on how to improve the state of our delivery
infrastructure. At points I would use half of my time on a project
working on infrastructure automation tasks and was scolded for
working on non value added tasks.
</p>

<p>
This was very sad to experience
because not attending to those tasks was one of the top reasons
deliveries were unreliable and slow. To me it was like apartment
mates living together and complaining that the apartment stinks but
no one has any time to take the garbage out.
</p>

<p>
AI/ML was attractive to me both because it constantly generated
headlines, and aligns well with
personal interest in the automation of knowledge organization and discovery.
It was also a change that would allow me to bring some of my 
transferable skills and not start from scratch.
</p>

<p>
During my research, there were two main resources that I relied
upon to Learn about what AI projects might look like in the
industry:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a href="/tag/chollet.html">Chollet</a>'s
book:
<a href="https://amzn.to/3BsKjwK"
               target="_blank">
               Deep Learning with Python.
            </a>
the Universal Machine Learning workflow was exactly what I was
looking for at the time, a high-level overview of the lifecycle
of an ML Project</li>

<li>Andrew Ng's AI career guide: he breaks down the different roles
required to run successful AI projects in the enterprise
world. His site also has tools to asses your readiness for a
given role</li>
</ol>


<p>
Once a software engineer, always a software engineer
</p>

<p>
I found both resources, super useful, and at the same time I was
disheartened to learn that machine learning projects for commercial
companies look almost the same as software projects. I started to
de-prioritize, learning more about Machine Learning in the industry,
and decided to learn more about infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
Data, scientist, machine, learning, engineers, and other people with
specialized skills that make them very valuable for ML projects
typically lack the practical experience in delivering scalable,
reliable systems to production environments. To me that meant that
were I to join such projects, I would end up exactly in the same
role that I was trying to escape, namely, thinking about the
infrastructure, reliability and automation to achieve repeatable
deployment to production environment.

<h2 id="orgdaa8a5c"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Act III</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
During my vacation I made the resolution to double down and continue
working as a software engineer and become even more proficient writing
code for applications and release automation.
</p>

<p>
My resolution lasted less than 4 hours after my return to work. On
my first day after vacation, all it took was to read my mailbox and
chat messages to remind me why I was considering a change in the
first place: broken pipelines, a long queue of pull requests on
which most feedback is brushed off as nitpicking, pull requests that
are 2000 LOC long, non-stop merging to the mainline even after it
has been broken for 2 weeks, team retrospectives that do not produce
any value, aggressive deadlines but no compromises on scope, the
need to reinvent the wheel on every small module just because
developers are not familiar enough with the programming framework we
use and them not feeling like they can invest any time toe learn on
the job since they have a tight dealines, the constant churn of
external consultants that need to be onboarded and that only makes
late projects even later, etc, etc, etc.
</p>

<p>
I started looking for a change on the same day and that would lead
me into the world of IT infrastructure architecture.
</p>

<p>
The company is large and more than 100 years old, it has deployed
pretty much any technology worth mentioning in the last 50 years. My
IT universe expanded from delivery pipelines, and infrastructure
automation to anything from robots used in logistics warehouses,
temperature control systems, HR systems, telephony/fax/printing
hardware, and all other kinds of IT related projects, of which I
would have never known.
</p>

<p>
Before my role as infrastructure architect, I already thought that
infrastructure was a huge domain, but I could still see the edges of
my IT universe. It's 2024, two years on the new role I can say that
I have never felt that way again; the IT universe keeps expanding,
and its boundaries are unknown to me.
</p>

<p>
After a couple of years of switching to focus on IT infrastructure
architecture, I'm out of it again, now focusing on learning more
about cloud architecture a small subet of IT infrastructure, maybe
this time it will last longer, let's just hope that Cloud is not
just nother fad.

<h2 id="orgd57847d"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Finding your own path</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Over the past few years I have met with colleagues and friends who
are at stage on their careers, where they are not sure whether they
want to continue on the current path or take a different one. Many
of them, like me find the field of artificial intelligence, very
attractive, but they also haven't had any practical experience
machine learning engineer any project. So if you are considering
such a move, I can highly recommend Chollet's book. It's a window
into the world of machine learning engineering in the industry,
directly from an influential software engineer and AI researcher.
