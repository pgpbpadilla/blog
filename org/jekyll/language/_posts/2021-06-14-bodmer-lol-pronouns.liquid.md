In his book, [The Loom of Language](bodmer-lol-pronouns#references),
LOL from now onwards, Bodmer gives advice on strategies for learning
a modern language.

{% include amzn_affiliate_disclaimer.html %}

Here's what Bodmer has to say about learning a modern language:

> ... we can lighten the tedium of getting a reading knowledge of a language, or of
> writing it intelligibly, if we concentrate first on learning:
> - flexional derivatives least easy to recognize, when we look up the standard form
> given in a dictionary
> - flexional derivatives which still affect the meaning of a statement
>
> To the first class belong the personal pronouns. It should be our first task to memorize
> them.

I personally don't enjoy rot memorization exercises, but I found it entertaining to
make a table to help me visualize the different forms of the pronouns. The table is
inspired on Bodmer's suggestions, however, the tables in LOL contain forms of the pronouns
used in old English, which seem not so relevant today. Therefore, I have omitted those
forms in the table below.

        Different forms of personal pronouns in English, Spanish and German.
    </figcaption>
</div>

The table is also inspired by [an answer I found](#references) in the English Language
Stack Exchange while trying to decipher the difference between the old
English pronouns _thou_ and _thee_. In find the paradigm proposed very intuitive and
easy to remember.

## The dimensions of pronouns

Pronouns can belong to discrete categories along two dimensions:

- **Who** is being referred to
- **How many** are being referred to

For the **Who** dimension, I have used the labels:

- **I**, to refer to the speaker itself
- **You**, to refer _directly_ to someone other than the speaker
- **They**, to refer _indirectly_ to someone other than the speaker

For the **How many** dimension, I have used the labels:

- **Singular form** to refer to a single individual, e.g., _I, you, he/she/it_.
- **Plural form** to refer to a group, e.g., _we, you, they_.
