<p>
Can distributed teams be agile? Does Jira kill agility? Here are my
2 cents.
</p>

<p>
I was scrolling LinkedIn when I saw a picture of Jira executing a
wrestling splash on Agility. It triggered a train of thought about the
place for tools like Jira in the context of distributed teams that
span different time zones and on which the team members often have to
split their attention into multiple projects.

<p>
In my experience, as a software engineer, I have seen that the words
Agile, Scrum, and Kanban are often used interchangeably. One reason
for this is that the key ideas of each one fits really well with the
others. These ways of work share some assumptions:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Team co-location: everybody is in the same geographical location,
building, or room</li>
<li>Undivided attention: each person contributes to a single
team/project/product</li>
</ol>


<p>
How can distributed teams remain agile when these two assumptions are
broken? Before we go into the challenges that distributed teams face,
let's take a quick look at key differences between Agile, Scrum and
Kanban.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Agile: originated in software development with a focus on
delivery of value through close collaboration with customers and being
flexible in responding to change</li>
<li>SCRUM: originated in software development with a focus on time-boxed
delivery cycles (iterations) with a fixed scope</li>
<li>Kanban: originated in manufacturing with a focus on visualizing
work, managing flow, and reducing waste</li>
</ol>


<p>
The fact that the terms are used interchangeably it's a reminder of
how similar the philosophies are. These ways of working are
complementary and teams mix and match practices from all
of them without batting an eyelash.

<h2 id="orgf473ae2"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Documentation is communication is documentation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
The distinction between communication and documentation can be
blurry for distributed teams. Recorded communication can be seen as
extended documentation, at the same time, documentation is a form of
communication.
</p>

<p>
Distributed teams can use recorded communication like chat, email,
comments, etc. to bridge the gap created by geography. As long as
communication is given priority over the tools or processes, the use
of documentation as communication seems to maintain the spirit of
the age of manifesto.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Some complex tasks require sharing context with multiple people.
Consolidating context in a central location such as Jira/Wiki, makes
it easier to onboard newcomers.

<h2 id="org11108b7"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Documentation and context switching</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Distributed teams are often composed of individuals that participate
in multiple projects simultaneously. Individuals who have to split
their attention into multiple projects reduce the impact created by
context switching by documenting useful details, such as the current
status, and planned next steps.

<p>
For distributed teams, systems like Jira serve as a central place
for coordinating work. I find it intriguing that people with
technical IT skills often forget the value of systems like JIRA and
at the same time they can deliver complex systems, such as web
applications, computer networks, storage systems, etc.
</p>

<p>
Jira is bloated, complex, and not user-friendly. At the same time it
does not impose any workflow or methodology.

<h2 id="org6485fc6"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> Every project management tool wants to become like JIRA</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
In principle, e-mail is sufficient. However, once you get used to
the amenities of modern collaboration tools, it's hard to go back
and use only e-mail. Popular collaboration tools seem to be
converging in terms of features, for example, creating a task from a
chat conversation, tracking status, assigning, visualizing tasks and
their relationships, linking to code or documentation, etc.
</p>

<p>
Project management and collaboration is a complex domain, which
explains why most tools offer a terrible user experience. I always
remind myself that it could be worse, imagine doing project
management only with email and PowerPoint.
</p>

<p>
Companies arrive to systems like JIRA by taking a
holistic/integrated approach. It's not perfect, but the available
options are only a round of funding away from becoming like Jira.
