Welcome to my blog! I started it with a couple of goals in mind, namely, 
to practice my writing skills and to promote ideas that I find interesting.

My professional background is as a computer programmer and so many of the 
topics are related to programming computers. 

The idea of automating the process of organizing and discovering knowledge has been in 
my mind since 2008, this blog is an attempt for me to organize 
my thoughts around it.
