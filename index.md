Welcome to my blog! I started it with a couple of goals in mind, namely, 
to practice my writing skills and promote ideas that I find interesting.

My professional background is as a computer programmer and so many of the 
topics are related to programming computers. 

The idea of automating the process of discovering new knowledge has been in 
my mind for at least 12 years, this blog is an attempt for me to organize 
my thoughts around it. This means, most of the content will not be original, but
I hope that it's at least interesting for people interested in this topic.
